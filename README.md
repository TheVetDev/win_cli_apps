# Windows Command Line Apps

Coming from Linux I do love the command line. So I thought I would make a collection of cool command line apps for Windows. 

## Text Editors
* [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) - Similar to nano on nix environments. 

## Utilities
* [Ntop](https://github.com/Nuke928/NTop) - htop-like system-monitor for Windows with Vi-keybindings.
* [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) - Get your internet up and down speed.
